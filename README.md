## Sample gRPC Implementation Overview

In this project, a sample implementation of gRPC communication has been realized. Two distinct services constitute the architecture:

1. **Sample.GRPC.Client.API**: This service encapsulates CRUD operations, utilizing a gRPC client to interact with the underlying Sample.GRPC.Server.API.

2. **Sample.GRPC.Server.API**: This service functions as a gRPC server, facilitating CRUD operations. For testing purposes, an in-memory database has been employed.

## Technical Explanation

### gRPC

gRPC stands as a modern, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework, boasting high performance and versatility. It excels in connecting services across various environments, offering features such as load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. Notably, it extends its utility from data center interconnectivity to the last mile of distributed computing, seamlessly linking devices, mobile applications, and browsers to backend services.

Key Advantages of gRPC:

1. **High-Speed RPC Framework**: Provides advanced performance and agility in communication.
   
2. **Contract-First Approach**: Utilizes Protocol Buffers for API development, enabling language-agnostic implementations.
   
3. **Rich Tooling Support**: Offers robust tooling across different languages for generating typed servers and clients.
   
4. **Streaming Support**: Enables streaming communication for clients, servers, and bidirectional scenarios.
   
5. **Efficient Serialization**: Minimizes network overhead through the binary serialization of Protobuf.

gRPC finds optimal application in:

- **Microservices Architectures**: Prioritizes efficiency and streamlined communication.
  
- **Polyglot Environments**: Facilitates development across multiple languages.
  
- **Real-Time Services**: Seamlessly handles streaming requests and responses.

### Proto File

The initial step involves defining a proto file, adhering to established conventions and guidelines:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/any.proto";
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

option csharp_namespace = "SampleServiceProto";

package sampleservice;

service SampleServiceApi {
  rpc Gets (Empty) returns (responseEntitiesModel);
  rpc GetSingle (entityRequest) returns (responseEntityModel);
  rpc Create (CreationRequest) returns (operationCompleteModel);
  rpc Update (UpdateRequest) returns (operationCompleteModel);
  rpc Delete (entityRequest) returns (responseModel);
}

// Message and service definitions follow...
```

Key Points for Compiling Proto Files:

- **File Extension**: Utilize the ".proto" extension for proto files.
  
- **Syntax Declaration**: Begin with a syntax declaration, specifying the Protocol Buffers version.
  
- **Package Declaration**: Declare a package to prevent naming conflicts, ideally using reverse domain notation.
  
- **Imports**: Include necessary imports for external proto files.
  
- **Service and RPC Definitions**: Define services and RPC methods within, specifying request and response types.
  
- **Message Definitions**: Define message types with specific fields and types.
  
- **Comments and Well-Known Types**: Use comments for documentation and prefer well-known types for common data structures.

Adherence to these rules ensures readability, consistency, and compatibility across different gRPC implementations.

## Server API

The server-side implementation showcases efficient handling of CRUD operations:

```csharp
public class GrpcSampleService : SampleServiceApi.SampleServiceApiBase
{
    // Method implementations...
}
```

## Client API

The client-side implementation provides a seamless interface for interacting with the server:

```csharp
public class ServiceClientGrpc : IServiceClientGrpc
{
    // Method implementations...
}
```
